Premium calculation and quote aggregation logic spans multiple components:

## Core Rating Components
Importance Score: 95

Premium calculations incorporate:
- Health class determination based on height/weight/blood pressure matrices
- Tobacco use rating factors (12/24 month lookback)
- Age-nearest birthday calculation with 6-month rounding 
- Face amount band breakpoints at standard tiers
- Modal premium factors for payment frequency adjustments

## Multi-Carrier Quote Aggregation 
Importance Score: 90

Quote consolidation workflow:
1. Parallel carrier quote requests with provider-specific formatting
2. Normalization of disparate carrier rate structures
3. Premium comparison with carrier-specific:
   - Rate class mapping
   - Product eligibility rules
   - State availability filters
4. Best value determination using weighted scoring:
   - Premium cost (40%)
   - Financial rating (30%) 
   - Conversion options (20%)
   - Product features (10%)

## Rate Class Assignment
Importance Score: 85

Health class determination algorithm:
1. Build rate class matrix from:
   - Height/weight tables
   - Blood pressure readings
   - Family history factors
   - Lab results when available
2. Apply tobacco use classifications
3. Calculate final health class using most conservative rating
4. Map standardized health class to carrier-specific classes

## Premium Adjustments
Importance Score: 80

Rate modification factors:
- Flat extras for hazardous activities
- Table ratings for medical conditions
- Rider premium calculations
- Policy fee additions
- Modal premium conversions
- State-specific premium tax adjustments
