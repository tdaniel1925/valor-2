## Commission Distribution Model

Hierarchical commission splits follow organization structure with predefined distribution rates:
- Executive Level: 5% base commission
- Manager Level: 15% base commission  
- Agent Level: 50% base commission

Multi-tier commission calculations cascade through organizational levels with inherited splits. Child organizations receive remaining commission percentages after parent-level deductions.

## Organization Hierarchy Implementation

Commission flows map to organizational structure:
- IMO (Insurance Marketing Organization) - Top level
- MGA (Managing General Agent) - Mid level 
- Agency - Base level

Each level inherits commission split rules and contract relationships from parent organizations.

## Contract Commission Assignment

Contract status transitions affect commission eligibility:
- PENDING: No commission distribution
- APPROVED: Commission structure activated
- ACTIVE: Commission payments enabled

Commission levels assign based on:
- Organization tier position
- Contract type qualifications
- Product line authorizations

## Period-Based Commission Tracking

Commission calculations segment by timeframes:
- MTD (Month-to-Date)
- QTD (Quarter-to-Date)  
- YTD (Year-to-Date)

Split amounts track both:
- Gross commission value
- Net distribution after hierarchical splits
