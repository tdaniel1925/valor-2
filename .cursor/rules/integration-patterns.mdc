## Carrier Integration Framework
Importance Score: 85

Core integration patterns for normalizing and transforming insurance carrier data:

### Quote Aggregation System
- Consolidates quotes from multiple providers:
  - WinFlex API integration
  - iPipeline quote system
  - RateWatch data feeds
- Normalizes disparate carrier formats into unified structure
- Transforms carrier-specific product codes and classifications

### Provider Data Transformations
- Health class mapping across carriers:
  - Preferred Plus → Super Preferred
  - Standard Plus → Select
- Premium mode conversions:
  - Annual → Monthly, Quarterly
  - Modal factor applications
- Product type standardization:
  - Term → Level Term
  - ROP → Return of Premium

### Quote Normalization Process
- Standardizes carrier-specific fields:
  - Premium rates
  - Product features
  - Rider availability
- Applies carrier-specific business rules:
  - State availability filters
  - Face amount restrictions
  - Age limitations
  - Tobacco classifications

## Integration Protocols
- Quote request transformation rules
- Response parsing and normalization
- Error mapping and standardization
- Carrier-specific retry policies
- Required field mappings per carrier

## Data Flow Architecture
- Carrier API gateway routing
- Quote request orchestration
- Response aggregation patterns
- Error handling protocols
- Field validation rules

The system implements sophisticated carrier integration patterns focused on normalizing disparate insurance data formats and managing complex transformations between different provider systems.
